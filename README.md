# CS3113Project4
This is my Project 4 work for CS 3113.

Instructions:

Run main.cpp to run the game.

Use the Left and Right arrow keys to move the playable character Arle (The girl with orange hair and blue and white clothes) left and right. Press the Z key to jump and the X key to shoot a fireball. Only three fireballs can be present on the screen at a time.

If the enemy touches you, you die and the game is over. If you shoot a fireball at an enemy, the enemy will die. If you defeat all three enemies, you win the game.

Enemy descriptions:
Onion Pixy: The onion creature with the spiky bat. Every few seconds, he will dash into your direction and stop.

Draco: The girl with green hair and the red dress. She moves left and right within a small area. She will jump whenever a fireball is about to hit her, so you must aim carefully.

Witch: The girl with blonde hair and dark blue clothes. She flies to the left and right of the screen constantly.
